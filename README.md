# 8-Bit ALU Using Xilinx Vivado

## Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Xilinx Vivado. The ALU performs a range of arithmetic and logical operations on 8-bit binary inputs.

---

## Features
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Addition, Subtraction
- **Logical Operations:** AND, OR, XOR, NOT
- **Shift Operations:** Left Shift, Right Shift
- Supports **zero flag**, **carry flag**, and **overflow detection**

## How to Use

### Simulation Steps
1. Open Xilinx Vivado and create a new project.
2. Add the `alu.v` file to the project.
3. Add the `alu_tb.v` file as the testbench.
4. Run behavioral simulation to verify the ALU functionality.

### Synthesis and Implementation
1. Open Xilinx Vivado and synthesize the `alu.v` file.
2. Generate the bitstream for implementation.
3. Test the design on hardware (if available).

## Inputs and Outputs
### Inputs:
- **A[7:0]:** First 8-bit input operand.
- **B[7:0]:** Second 8-bit input operand.
- **Opcode[3:0]:** Operation selector (e.g., addition, AND, etc.).

### Outputs:
- **Result[7:0]:** 8-bit result of the selected operation.
- **Flags:** Zero flag, Carry flag, Overflow flag.

| Opcode | Operation        | Description               |
|--------|------------------|---------------------------|
| 0000   | Addition         | Adds A and B             |
| 0001   | Subtraction      | Subtracts B from A       |
| 0010   | AND              | Bitwise AND of A and B   |
| 0011   | OR               | Bitwise OR of A and B    |
| 0100   | XOR              | Bitwise XOR of A and B   |
| 0101   | NOT              | Bitwise NOT of A         |
| 0110   | Left Shift       | Logical left shift of A  |
| 0111   | Right Shift      | Logical right shift of A |
